From GraphicsLabs project and tracking version files, this project will evolve towards new 
requirements.
- Try a maximum of 10 bubbles in a time, dynamically numbered. By a data structure if necesary
- Bubbles do not fade out of screen, but just bouncing at screen boundaries (when the 
center of the bubble reaches the edge or just as natural, when its first point touches)
- Let's allow bubbles bounces between them. 
- Colors. Sounds.
